# Assembly-Language-Catch-Alphabets
This Assembly Language Program(Intel 8088, tested on DOSBox) is the implementation of the game "Catch Alphabets". It generates random alphabets falling at different speeds which have to be caught by the user using arrow keys. Scores and missed alphabets are updated and shown simultaneously. The game ends once the user misses 10 alphabets. This is a pairwork, done with a friend.
# Compiler
The code is tested on DOSBox.
